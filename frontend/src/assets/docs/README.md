## **Basic Concepts**
### **Knowledge Base**
A collection of knowledge related to a specific domain, such as **logistics scheduling** or **customer service knowledge bases**.

### **Knowledge Base Topic**
Different topics within a knowledge base, each representing an independent knowledge network.

### **Nodes**
The core data units in the knowledge network:
- **Node (General Nodes)**
  - **ROOT**: The root node of the knowledge base.
  - **SUBJECT**: The root node of a topic.
  - **QUESTION**: Nodes used for retrieval, generated by AI.
  - **PROMPT**: A question or hint node.
  - **INFO**: AI-generated information nodes (text, documents, websites, etc.).
  - **HUMAN**: Manually created knowledge nodes.

### **Relationships**
- **HAS_CHILD**: Represents a parent-child relationship.
- **RELATED_TO**: Represents a link between nodes.

## **Database Structure**
### **Relational Database (PostgreSQL)**
- **Knowledge Base Table**: Stores basic knowledge base information.
- **Knowledge Base Topic Table**: Stores different knowledge topics.
- **User Data Table**: Manages user data for multi-user isolation.

### **Graph Database (Neo4j)**
- **Nodes**: Each node has **lib_id** and **subject_id** for data isolation.
- **Relationships**: Define hierarchical and associative relationships.
- **Vector Storage**:
  - **Text Embedding**: Each text node contains an `embedding` attribute.
  - **Neo4j HNSW Vector Index**: Enables efficient similarity searches.

### **Milvus (Future Vector Database)**
- Plans to store embeddings for questions/answers to enhance similarity search efficiency.

### **Database structure description**
#### **Relational database (PostgreSQL)**
- **Knowledge Base**: used to store basic information of the knowledge base
- **Knowledge Base Topic**: used to store information of each topic
- **User Data**: used to manage user data and implement user isolation of the knowledge base

#### **Graph database (Neo4j)**
- **Nodes**
- **ROOT**: root node related to the knowledge base
- **SUBJECT**: topic node related to the knowledge base
- **QUESTION**: question node, used to store questions raised by users
- **PROMPT**: prompt node, used to store user prompt information
- **INFO**: information node, used to store knowledge point content (text, file, URL, etc.)
- **HUMAN**: manually input information node, used to store manually input knowledge point content (text, file, URL, etc.)
- **Entity**, **Keyword**, **Tag**, **DocumentPage**, **Document**, **WebPage**, these auxiliary nodes are not displayed in the network diagram, but can be viewed and maintained in the node properties
- All nodes contain **lib_id** and **subject_id** to ensure the isolation and maintenance of data between different knowledge bases

- **Relationships**
- Used to represent the hierarchy (HAS_CHILD) and association (RELATED_TO) between nodes
- All relationships contain **lib_id** and **subject_id** to ensure the isolation and maintenance of data between different knowledge bases
